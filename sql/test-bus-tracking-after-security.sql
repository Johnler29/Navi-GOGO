-- üß™ Test Bus Tracking After Security Fixes
-- This script tests that bus tracking functionality still works after applying security fixes

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 1: Verify RPC Function Still Works
-- ============================================================================

-- Test the update_bus_location_simple function (should work regardless of RLS)
SELECT 'Testing RPC function...' as test_step;

-- This should work even with RLS enabled (RPC functions bypass RLS)
SELECT update_bus_location_simple(
    (SELECT id FROM buses LIMIT 1),  -- Use first available bus
    14.5995,  -- Test latitude
    120.9842, -- Test longitude
    10.0,     -- Test accuracy
    25.0      -- Test speed
) as rpc_test_result;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 2: Verify Anonymous Access to Active Buses
-- ============================================================================

-- Test anonymous access to active buses (should work for passenger maps)
SET ROLE anon;

SELECT 'Testing anonymous access to active buses...' as test_step;

-- This should work - anonymous users can view active buses
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as active_buses_count,
    'Anonymous can see active buses' as status
FROM buses 
WHERE status = 'active';

-- This should also work - anonymous users can view all buses through authenticated policy
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_buses_count,
    'Anonymous can see all buses' as status
FROM buses;

-- Reset role
RESET ROLE;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 3: Verify Real-time Subscription Capability
-- ============================================================================

-- Test that real-time subscriptions can still read the buses table
SELECT 'Testing real-time subscription capability...' as test_step;

-- Check if we can read buses table (needed for real-time)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as buses_available_for_realtime,
    'Real-time can access buses' as status
FROM buses;

-- Check specific columns needed for real-time tracking
SELECT 
    id,
    bus_number,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    speed,
    tracking_status,
    last_location_update
FROM buses 
WHERE status = 'active'
LIMIT 3;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 4: Verify Driver Update Capability
-- ============================================================================

-- Test driver update capability (this would need a real driver ID)
SELECT 'Testing driver update capability...' as test_step;

-- Check if there are any drivers assigned to buses
SELECT 
    b.id as bus_id,
    b.bus_number,
    b.driver_id,
    d.name as driver_name,
    'Driver can update this bus' as status
FROM buses b
LEFT JOIN drivers d ON d.id = b.driver_id
WHERE b.driver_id IS NOT NULL
LIMIT 3;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 5: Verify Real-time Publication Status
-- ============================================================================

-- Check if buses table is still in real-time publication
SELECT 'Testing real-time publication status...' as test_step;

SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    'Table is in real-time publication' as status
FROM pg_publication_tables 
WHERE pubname = 'supabase_realtime' 
AND tablename = 'buses';

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 6: Simulate Real-time Update
-- ============================================================================

-- Simulate a real-time update by updating a bus location
SELECT 'Simulating real-time update...' as test_step;

-- Update a bus location to trigger real-time event
UPDATE buses 
SET 
    latitude = 14.5995 + (random() - 0.5) * 0.001,
    longitude = 120.9842 + (random() - 0.5) * 0.001,
    speed = 25.0 + (random() - 0.5) * 10,
    tracking_status = 'moving',
    last_location_update = NOW(),
    updated_at = NOW()
WHERE id IN (SELECT id FROM buses WHERE status = 'active' LIMIT 1);

-- Check the update was successful
SELECT 
    id,
    bus_number,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    speed,
    tracking_status,
    last_location_update,
    'Update successful' as status
FROM buses 
WHERE status = 'active'
ORDER BY last_location_update DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 7: Verify RLS Policies Are Working
-- ============================================================================

-- Test that RLS policies are properly applied
SELECT 'Testing RLS policies...' as test_step;

-- Check RLS status
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    rowsecurity as rls_enabled,
    CASE 
        WHEN rowsecurity THEN '‚úÖ RLS Enabled'
        ELSE '‚ùå RLS Disabled'
    END as status
FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'buses';

-- Check policies
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    policyname,
    cmd,
    CASE 
        WHEN cmd = 'SELECT' THEN '‚úÖ Read Access'
        WHEN cmd = 'UPDATE' THEN '‚úÖ Update Access'
        WHEN cmd = 'INSERT' THEN '‚úÖ Insert Access'
        WHEN cmd = 'DELETE' THEN '‚úÖ Delete Access'
        ELSE '‚ùì Other Access'
    END as access_type
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND tablename = 'buses'
ORDER BY cmd;

-- ============================================================================
-- Test 8: Performance Check
-- ============================================================================

-- Check if queries are still performant
SELECT 'Testing query performance...' as test_step;

-- Time a simple query
EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS) 
SELECT 
    id,
    bus_number,
    latitude,
    longitude,
    speed,
    tracking_status
FROM buses 
WHERE status = 'active';

SELECT 'üéâ Bus Tracking Test Complete!' as summary;

-- Final verification
